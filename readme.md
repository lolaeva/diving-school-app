## Diving School Database Frontend App with Python, Tkinter, PostgreSQL
* Folder organization:
    * On main page there are two python files: the first is the main file **script.py** for running the app. The second is **backend.py** providing connection of the frontend to PostgreSQL database.
    * In the folder **app** there are other python files related to database tables. They are **student.py, program.py, group.py, trainer.py**

## Instructions on how to run the app on local:
To run on your local machine:
1. Check if Python is installed by typing in command prompt `python`. The version of python on which this app is developed is Python 3.8.1.
2. Create a virtualenv "venv" with `python -m venv virtual`. If you do not have
    virtualenv python package installed type `pip install virtualenv`. If pip is not installed, do so by `python get-pip.py`.
    Your virtual environment folder is now **virtualenv**.
3. Activate virtual environment with `source virtual/Scripts/activate`.
4. Install the requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
5. Run the application with `python script.py`.
6. If you install new packages during app development, add those to requirement.txt file 
   by `pip freeze > requirements.txt`.

## PotgreSQL to Heroku
* On Windows: ***Remember to update your PATH environment variable to add the bin directory of your Postgres installation. The directory will be similar to this: `C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\<VERSION>\bin`. If you forget to update your PATH, commands like heroku pg:psql wonâ€™t work.***
* Push:
    ```
    heroku pg:push diving_school 'DATABASE_URL' --app divingschooldb
    ```
* Troubleshooting:
    ```
    pg_dump -f diving_school.dump -Fc --no-acl -no-owner -h localhost -U postgres --schema=public diving_school

    heroku config:get DATABASE_URL --app divingschooldb

    pg_restore --verbose --no-acl --no-owner -U lmgcolusndmjrc -h ec2-3-233-206-99.compute-1.amazonaws.com -p 5432 -d dfie71fcq48391 < diving_school.dump
    ```
* Connecting in Python
    ```
    pip install psycopg2-binary
    ```
